<?php
phpinfo()
?>

Look, i've put the phpinfo output above but you shouldn't really need it. I believe we only utilise AWS and GCP to host the internal validator, with an internal Database running MariaDB. The project is simple and utilises minimal external dependencies, such as git-php, composer, and some others. If you need to ask any questions, reach out to me on internal channels, cheers!
